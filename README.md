Index.html, work.html, contact.html files created using bootstrap

main.css file created
In main.css file:
. Added underline to menu when hovering over
. Bootstrap colors changed
. Removed text decoration on links
. Added orange shape as background image to About page
. The contact form on the contact page has been stylized. 
. Added red focus frame for keyboard use.

Fixed the problems in index.html, work.html, contact.html files.
. Social media icons:
    Since the social media icons were in different div, they were moving away from each other when the page was narrowed. Problem solved when  placed it in the same div (because display: flex is used)
. Adding gap bettween box: 
  I had a hard time adding spaces between the boxes on the home and work pages. I was able to gutter them horizontally, but it didn't work vertically.
    . Removed img-thumbnail from class of all images.
    . Removed fixed image size from main.css
. On the About page, I added orangeshape-01.png to the background  in the html and section cut this png
    . Added orangeshape-01.png to main.css as background image.
    . background-size: cover: given

photography.html, printing.html, webux.html files created using bootstrap

Note: I learned to use boostrap throughout the project and it has made my job incredibly easy. I liked the feature of being responsive the most.
